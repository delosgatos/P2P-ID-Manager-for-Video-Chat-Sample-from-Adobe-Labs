Protocol description. This is a very simple protocol for user registration 
(or unregistration) and lookup.
 
For registration, client sends following query string to web-service:

GET ?username=user&identity=peer_id_of_user
 
Server should respond 200 OK with message body:
{"update":"true"}
 
For unregistration, client sends following request:
 
GET ?username=user&identity=0 HTTP/1.1
 
Server response is same as for registration. Registration is refreshed 
every 30 minutes.

For user lookup, client sends following request (to avoid caching,
request is randomized using time, etc.):
 
GET ?friends=remote_user HTTP/1.1

If remote user is available, server responds 200 OK with following message body:

{"friend":{
    "user":remote_user
    "identity":peer_id_of_remote_user
  }
}

If remote user is not available, server responds with 200 OK with following 
message body:
{"friend":{
    "user":remote_user
 }
}
